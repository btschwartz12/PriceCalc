# PriceCalc-CLT

### By: Ben Schwartz

PriceCalc-CLT is a C++ command-line tool that calculates the amount each person owes in a group food order, taking into account taxes and delivery fees. This tool is useful for splitting food orders between multiple people and ensuring that each person pays their fair share. 

One of the key features of PriceCalc-CLT is its support for mathematical expressions. This means that users can enter complex calculations such as "((total + tax + delivery) / number of people) * 1.2" to determine each person's contribution. 

Please note that this project was created a long time ago, and may require a rebuild and review to fully understand the usage instructions. This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the tool. To use PriceCalc-CLT, simply clone the repository and run the tool in your command line.
